        "description":"The above two images are simulation screenshots of the total deformation of the Honeycomb structure when one end of it is fixed. A point load of 100N is applied to another end of the Honeycomb Structure. The first picture is the Gradient Honeycomb structure, which offers more bending resistance than the regular honeycomb structure, the picture on the left.",
        "description1":"The above video is a simulated video to test impact loading on Honeycomb structure with cell variation along the core length. The above picture is energy probe analysis performed in Ansys (Explicit Dynamics). The green line and pink lines are kinetic energy and internal energy, respectively generated with the sphere's impact (Structural steel)  on Honeycomb Structure (Aluminium). The maximum values of internal and kinetic energy are 11.242 Joules and 13.718 Joules, respectively. The minimum value of internal and kinetic energy is 0 joules and 2.836 Joules, respectively."
